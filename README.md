# The Furry Game
While working on this task, I learned the technique of object oriented programming and why using objects, their methods and properties makes sense. :-)

The hero of this game is Furry who moves on a board using the arrow keys on the keyboard. There is a coin in a random field of the board. The player must move Furry to the coin. When he does that, the coin disappears from the board and appears in a different field, and the player gets 1 point. If the player hits a wall, the game ends.
